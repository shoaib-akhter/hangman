# Hangman - Ruby CLI Game

## Overview
This is a command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game in Ruby. The player tries to guess a randomly selected word within a limited number of incorrect attempts. The game includes features such as saving and loading progress, ensuring a seamless experience.

## Features
- **Word Selection from Dictionary**: Randomly selects a word between 5-12 characters from `dictionary.txt`.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players guess letters one at a time, with correct guesses revealed and incorrect guesses tracked.
- **Save & Load Functionality**: Players can save their progress and resume later.
- **Rubocop Compliant**: Ensures adherence to Ruby's best practices.
- **Game Ends Correctly**: Ends as soon as the word is guessed or attempts run out.

## Project Structure

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ player.rb      # Tracks guesses and remaining attempts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ save_load.rb   # Handles saving and loading the game state

â”‚â”€â”€ saved_games/       # Stores saved game files
â”‚â”€â”€ dictionary.txt     # List of words for Hangman
â”‚â”€â”€ main.rb            # Entry point to run the game

```

## How to Play
### Running the Game
Run the game using:
```sh
ruby main.rb
```

### Starting or Loading a Game
Upon starting, you will be prompted:
```
Do you want to load a saved game? (y/n)
```
- **y**: Loads the saved game.
- **n**: Starts a new game.

### Guessing Letters
- Type a **single letter** (e.g., `e`) and press **Enter**.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
- Incorrect guesses reduce remaining attempts.

### Saving Progress
At any point, type:
```
save
```
This will save the game and exit.

### Winning or Losing
- **Win:** If you guess all letters correctly, you win! ðŸŽ‰
- **Lose:** If attempts run out, the game ends.
